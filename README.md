Introduction

My name is Ahmed Mohamed, and I am a senior at Eden Prairie High School. I discovered this course from a friend in the high school who is also taking the course. Before taking this class, I took AP Computer Science as well as AP Java. The reason in me taking all these classes is because I enjoy learning about computers and coding. This portfolio I opened will show the progress I made in IOS App Development.
