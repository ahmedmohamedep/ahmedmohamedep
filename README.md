Introduction

My name is Ahmed Mohamed, and I am a senior at Eden Prairie High School. I discovered this course from a friend in the high school who is also taking the course. Before taking this class, I took AP Computer Science as well as AP Java. The reason in me taking all these classes is because I enjoy learning about computers and coding. This portfolio I opened will show the progress I made in IOS App Development.

Overview

I found out that learning Xcode is awesome and it was cool learning it in a "hands off" environment. While working on the apps, I have experimented with UI displays, shuch as stack views and segues, user input and timer functions. It took some challenges,  and I am still learning some things. 

Boxing Party was an app I was working on in the last 9 weeks. It was a fun idea of mine that had the user click on the glove on the scene and get most "punches" in the time limit. I had UI's for the scorekeeping and the segues so it can change screens for levels. I had trouble incorporating the timekeeper and the scorekeeping. In the future of the next term, I hope to add more to the app and add new innovations to it.
